This project will hold various helpful* Cocoa/Objective-C classes and other related things.

There are two sub-directories. "Cocoa Additions" has general Objective-C classes as well as Mac-specific classes. "iOS Cocoa Additions" has iOS/UIKit specific classes.

At the moment all files are standalone classes, but they are included in the AufflickCocoaAdditions project so they can be bundled with tests etc.

* I must have found them helpful, otherwise I wouldn't have bothered. YMMV.
